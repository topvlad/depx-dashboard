# depx-dashboard

This repository contains a Streamlit dashboard for visualizing crypto market data from the [`market-pulse`](https://github.com/topvlad/market-pulse) repository.

## Usage

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the dashboard locally:

The earlier prototype `app_test.py` has been removed in favor of `app.py`.
